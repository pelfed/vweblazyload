== Description ==

VisualWeb lazy load aim is to speed up your website powered by WordPress. 
It delays loading of images in (long) web pages. 
Images outside of viewport (visible part of web page) wont be loaded before user scrolls to them.
Unlike other plugins of similar type, this plugin allows you to choose the css selector(s) you want it applied to.

After activating the plugin, when the website is viewed,
the text will be loaded first and then the images. This will help reduce the loading time, the images will load later based on user screen scrolling by jQuery script. Scrolling down, more image will be loaded, no need to call an external server.
